# Machine Learning Algorithms – Practical Implementations

This repository contains implementations and experiments with fundamental
machine learning algorithms using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Algorithms Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Linear Regression
- K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate notebook and trained using a real
dataset. The notebooks include data preprocessing, model training, and
evaluation of results.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Environment
The notebooks were originally developed and executed using Google Colab.

## Notes
This project was completed as part of an Artificial Intelligence course and
focuses on practical understanding and comparison of core ML algorithms.
